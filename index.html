    I am a funny creative enthusiast student that is finding passion through Technology. I am known to be a problem solver and team player. My creative skills create an environment where everyone is welcome and ready to contribute.
    Working with me is like working with a consistent motivated and cheerleader as I will always find a way to fix or support someone. I am experienced in a fast-paced environment with daily to monthly duties. I am well-equipped with personal interaction and explanations.
    I was known to be a lead employee by training, teaching, and reviewing others' work. I am a well-rounded learner that is always ready to learn and share knowledge.
    Currently, I'm looking for a new company that can use my specific mix of abilities and experiences to profit from my contribution. Look over this website if you're interested, then get in touch.

  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>
    I am currently an upcoming sophomore with senior credits student at Augusta University studying Information Technology.
    I've been in college since the age of 14 (freshman year of high school) aiming to reach my goals. I am a hardworking daughter of three that decided to try a new career path and interest.
    I enjoy challenging myself and reaching my goals as a way to encourage and grow as an individual.
    Outside of school, I am either playing Volleyball or filming content for my YouTube channel. My future goals in my career are to one day work for the government in information systems or data management. Being a daughter to a military veteran that served in two branches (Air Force and Army), I am proud to say that I would love to gain experience and be able to share my skills with my country. In addition, I love traveling with my family due to my experience as a child and would love to continue those endeavors within my career.
    As I enjoyed 2 courses the most (information systems and principles of data management), I look forward to gaining experience one day in the career field. I am still open to growing my skills in web development to showcase my creativity and organization skills as well. Meanwhile, I am being influenced and exposed to amazing opportunities and possible pathways that I would love to dabble in the future.
